### Summary

* `run.sh` and browse to http://localhost:6160/src/sandbox.html
* `test.sh`
* This is a simple sandbox to test Typescript.
    - There is a dependency on RxJS, from my original project.
    - There is a simple HTML page but the main intent here is to run tests from CLI.
* the key point is the `older` function [here](./src/animal.ts)
